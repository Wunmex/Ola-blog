            <h3>My First Post</h3>
            <p>This is the content of my first blog post.
                A few months ago, I had no idea that typing a few lines of text could create something beautiful on screen. I was curious, and that
                curiosity led me to the world of web development.<br>
                My first step was learning HTML, the skeleton of every website. It felt like magic soon after, I discovered CSS which allowed me to style my pages and give them personality.<br>
                It wasn't always easy. I got stuck on simple things like spacing, aligning elements, and making things look the way I imagined.
                But every challenge was a lesson, and every solved problem made me more confident.

            <h3>Another Interesting Topic</h3>
            <p>Today, i can proudly say i've built small projects from basic layouts to styled pages and i'm still learning everyday.My goal is to 
                become a full-stack developer, create beautiful websites, and maybe inspire someone else to start their own coding journey.<br>
                If you're thinking of starting, my advice is:jut begin. You don't need to know anything at once just take one step at a time, and before
                you know it, you'll look back and see how far you've come.
